# jquery-load-with-js

helps you load html code with js and css thru coming from ajax call (don't ask why you would do that, ppl do it).

solves a problem when the scripts do not wait each load as if they loaded thru normal way, hence it maybe result is not found object, if some inline script depends on some lib
